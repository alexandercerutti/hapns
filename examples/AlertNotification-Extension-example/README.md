# (modified) Alert Notification example

This is an example for usage of `hapns`' `AlertNotification` for a notification that will get changed by a Notification extension (see https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/modifying-content-in-newly-delivered-notifications).

It is accompanied with an example iOS App that showcases how the notification is received and used by the application itself.

The example is made of a Node.JS server application and an iOS application.
The server file contains the instructions to set up the example on the server side.
