# FileProvider Notification example

This is an example for usage of `hapns`' `FileProviderNotification`.

It is accompanied with an example iOS App that showcases how the notification is received and used by the application itself.

The example is made of a Node.JS server application and an iOS application.
The server file contains the instructions to set up the example on the server side.

Run the following commands to run the server. This project uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) to assume `hapns` comes from the same repository (workspace).

```sh
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm run:example
```
